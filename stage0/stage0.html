  <h1>HTML Notes</h1>
    <p>
      HTML stands for hypertext markup language, and provides the structure for web pages.
      <br><em>When coding, you don't have to remember everything!!  If you don't know the answer,
      <b><a href= "http://www.google.com"> GOOGLE</a></b></em> it!
    </p>
  <h2>HTML Tags and How They Work</h2>
  <p>
    An HTML tag is a piece of HTML code that instructs the content within the tag to do something.
    <br>An element is some kind of content enclosed within an opening tag and a closing tag. Below
    <br>you will see the demonstration of multiple tags, and how they appear on the web browser
  </p>
  <div>
    <h3>P Tags</h3>
    <p>
      This demonstrates text within the first p tag
    </p>
    <p>
      This demonstrates text within a 2nd p tag.  Notice that the text within this p tag begins a 2nd paragraph
    </p>
    <h3>Strong Tags</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>
        This text is inside a strong tag.  It is basically the same thing as a b tag. Notice that this bold text
        is on a separate line because it is outside of the 2nd p tag, and therefore, not part of the paragraph above.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <h3>Form Tags</h3>
    <p>
      <form>
        This <em> text </em> is inside a form tag.
      </form>
      This text is outside the form tag. You can see that the form tag is "block" because it caused the text outside of it to start a new line.
    </p>
    <h3>br Tags</h3>
    <br>
    A br tag causes the text to start a new line, like this one.
    <br>
    <h3>Span Tags</h3>
    <p>
      <span>
        This text is inside of a span tag.
      </span>
      This text is outside the span tag. You can see that the span tag is "inline" because it did not cause the text outside of it to start a new line.
    </p>
    <h3>Div Tags</h3>
    <div>
      This text is inside of a div tag.
    </div>
    This text is outside of a div tag.  You can see that a div tag is "block" becuase it caused the text outside of it to start a new line.
  </div>
  <h3>Img Tags</h3>
  <p>
    Image tags allow you to display an image via providing a link or a hard drive location.

  <div class "Camden Pic">
    <img src = "C:\Users\212402808\Box Sync\DeWolf\Dave\camden.jpg" alt = "image could not load">

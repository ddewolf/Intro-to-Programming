	        <p>Boxes is a concept that is very widely used when building webpages.  If you look at a webpage as building blocks on top of one another,
	        that is literally how it is built.  Take for instance this mock web page:</p>
	        <div class="sample-page">
	            <div>
	              <h2 class="sample-header">My Webpage</h2>
	            </div>
	            <div class="hdivs">
	              <div class="redoutline">
	                <img src="images/oak-tree.jpg" alt="Giant Oak Tree" class="oak-tree">
	              </div>
	              <div class="sample-text">
	                  You can see that that I have included a red outline around all of the "boxes" that I am referring to on this sample page.  There is
	                  one large box around the entire page, one smaller box around the picture and text, and then smaller boxes around every sub-element: header, picture, text, and footer.  These boxes are created by using "block" type elements within your HTML coding.  In this example, 
	                  I have used DIV tags in order to create the boxes you see highlighted here.
	                <p>
	                  Its also important to note, that unless specified, the boxes will build one, on top of another, in the same order that the elements
	                  appear in the HTML code.  If you want your boxes to appear next to each other, you have to use a css property called "display: flex;"
	                  Here, I have defined the single box around the picture and text as "display: flex;"  That is why the text appears to the right of the 
	                  oak tree, instead of underneath it.
	                </p>
	              </div>
	            </div>
	            <div class="sample-header">
	              Webpage footer
	            </div>
	        </div> <!--Closing sample-page-->
          	<p class="extraspace">Once you have your content contained into boxes, and you have the boxes laid out the way you want, then you can customize within
	        the boxes by moving content around within the box, resizing, setting borders, max heights and widths, etc.  All of this 
	        "customizing" can be done using CSS.  Chances are, a CSS property exists for anything you are trying to do.  So, as long as you
	        know how you want the design to look, all you have to do is look up the CSS property, and apply it!</p>

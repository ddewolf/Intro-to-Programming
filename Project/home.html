          Hi. My name is Dave.  I am just starting to learn how to code in HTML.  This is my website, which I am using 
          to document everything that I am learning.  
        <p>
          HTML stands for hypertext markup language, and provides the structure for web pages.<em>When coding, you don't 
          have to remember everything!!  If you don't know the answer,<b><a href= "http://www.google.com"> GOOGLE</a></b></em> it!

	          An HTML tag is a piece of HTML code that instructs the content within the tag to do something.
	          An element is some kind of content enclosed within an opening tag and a closing tag. Below
	          you will see the demonstration of multiple tags, and how they appear on the web browser

      <div id="ptag">
      	<div class=header4>
        	<h4>P Tags</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          This demonstrates text within the first p tag
        </p>
        <p>
          This demonstrates text within a 2nd p tag.  Notice that the text within this p tag begins a 2nd paragraph
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="strongtag">
      	<div class=header4>
        	<h4>Strong Tags</h4>
        </div>
          <strong>
            This text is inside a strong tag.  It is basically the same thing as a b tag. Notice that this bold text
            is on a separate line because it is outside of the 2nd p tag, and therefore, not part of the paragraph above.
          </strong>
      </div>

      <div id="formtag">
     	<div class=header4>
        	<h4>Form Tags</h4>
        </div>
          <form>
            This <em> text </em> is inside a form tag.
          </form>
          This text is outside the form tag. You can see that the form tag is <em>"block"</em> because it caused the text
          outside of it to start a new line.
      </div>

      <div id="brtag">
      	<div class=header4>
        	<h4>br Tags</h4>
        </div>
        <br>
        A br tag causes the text to start a new line, like this one.
        <br>

      <div id="spantag">
      	<div class=header4>

          <span class="whiteoutline">
            This text is inside of a span tag.
          </span>
          This text is outside the span tag. You can see that the span tag is <em>"inline"</em> because it did not cause
          the text outside of it to start a new line.
      </div>

      <div id="divtag">
      	<div class=header4>
        	<h4>Div Tags</h4>
        </div>
          <div class="redoutline">
            This text is inside of a div tag.
          </div>
          This text is outside of a div tag.  You can see that a div tag is <em>"block"</em> becuase it caused the text
          outside of it to start a new line.
      </div>

      <div id="imgtag">
      	<div class=header4>

        <h4>Styling your Webpage</h4>
      </div>
      <div>
          After content, like pictures and text, are added to your HTML file, you'll probably want to "style" your page.  
          Styling refers to making your content appear exactly how you want it to appear.  Simple examples would be bolding, or 
          underlining text, setting background colors, positioning content exactly where you want it, etc. 
          There are several different ways to do this. 
      </div>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li class="largetext">Styling within HTML</li>
            <div>
              This can be done by writing the style directly into each element within the HTML file.  For example:
              <div class="code-example">
                <xmp> 
                  <div style="background-color: blue, color: white"> 
                    This will be white text with a blue background 
                  </div> 
                </xmp>
              </div>
            </div>
        </ul>

        <div>
            CSS, or cascading style sheets, uses references, in which you define, to "cascade" onto the elements that you want.  
            Therefore, if there is a certain "style" of text you want to use for all the headers on your page, you only have
            to define this "style" one time, then apply it to all headers on the page.  These "definitions" can be made in the
            HEAD section of your HTML document, or you can store them in a separate .css file.  
        </div>

        <ul>
          <li class="largetext">CSS styling in the head of your HTML doc</li>
            <div>
              CSS can be written directly into your HTML file in the HEAD section, and this will cascade down to wherever those styles
              are called out on the page.  For example:
              <div class="code-example">
                <xmp> 
                <head>
                  <style>
                    div {
                      background-color: blue;
                    }
                  </style>
                </head>
                <body>
                  <div>
                    This text will have a blue background
                  </div>
                </body>
                </xmp>
              </div>
            </div>

          <li class="largetext">Linking your HTML file to a separate CSS file</li>
            <div>
              Alternatively, CSS can be written on a separate "style sheet" and then linked to the HTML document.  This is the preferred
              method for larger projects.  CSS has its own format to be used, in which the "style" of element classes are defined.  For 
              example:
              <div class="code-example">
                <xmp>
                    .header1,
                    .header2, 
                    .header3, 
                    .header4 {
                      font-weight: bolder;
                      background-color: gray;
                      color: navy;
                    }                            
                </xmp>
              </div>
                The above statement is defining the font and background color for headers 1, 2, 3, and 4.  For example, anytime an element is 
                listed with a class="header1", the text in that element will bear what was defined above. 
              <div class="code-example"> 
                <xmp>
                  <div class="header1">
                    This text will be a bold, navy color, with a gray background.
                  </div>
                </xmp>
              </div>
            </div>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="header4">

        There are an infinite number of resources available for web developers.  However, I want to share a few that will be a huge help.

          <div>
          <li class="largetext">Google Chrome Developer Tools</li>
            Within the Google Chrome dropdown menu, navigate to More tools > Developer tools.  You should be able to see both the HTML and 
            the CSS (Styles). Here, you can edit code on the fly, and view the changes to the website in real time.  This is very useful
            when trying to figure out how a certain design will look.  You can literally make the change, on the fly in Google Chrome, and 
            then go back and add the change to your HTML and CSS files.
